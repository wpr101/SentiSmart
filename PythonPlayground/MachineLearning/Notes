True test is the forward test
Test against data you have not seen
When same variables present themselves, outcome may be similar
Look for patterns
Data snooping: making new inferences based on data
Machine learning has data snooping built in, and accounted for
Built on pattern recognition
Back testing serves a truthful purpose
Machine learning helping confirming the hypothesis
Percent change will be used, and needs to be normalized, logrithmically more accurate
Forward % change, can do a reverse point change day 9 to day 8 for example
Compare current pattern to similar patterns
Did similar patterns have a similar outcome?
