Limiting to small caps performed very poorly
Allowing companies less than 500 million looks to be hurting
Worst performer was small caps, no P/E... looks like bigger with P/E is good
Strategies without P/E getting hurt

3/3
Top gainers are definitely not following through the next day, accuracy at 20%
None of the technicals seemed to help, but could be because other underlying 
conditions such as market cap were not setup
