Try a new top 30 screen each day sorting on different factors
Find the factors which yield the best next day returns
We plan to sell in last 30 minutes of next day
Find stocks which show up in multiple screens and see how they do

Looks like P/E ratio and market cap greater than 500 are must
Would be interesting to add dividend or other good fundamentals
Screen 6 did better on an up day, and Screen 2 did better on a down day
Screen 6 has the best accuracy
Should add a volume requirement as well

Factors we definitely want:
1) Market CAP greater than 500 million
2) Has a P/E ratio
3) Volume greater than 20000
