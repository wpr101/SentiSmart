Try a new top 30 screen each day sorting on different factors
Find the factors which yield the best next day returns
We plan to sell in last 30 minutes of next day
Find stocks which show up in multiple screens and see how they do

Looks like P/E ratio and market cap greater than 500 are must
Would be interesting to add dividend or other good fundamentals
Screen 6 did better on an up day, and Screen 2 did better on a down day
Screen 6 has the best accuracy
Should add a volume requirement as well

Factors we definitely want:
1) Market CAP greater than 500 million
2) Has a P/E ratio
3) Volume greater than 50000 or more

3/3
Screen6 was the clear winner again.

Bought into a company which had a downgrade.

AVOID:
1) Sector the company is in trading down
2) There is news surrounding the company
3) Heavy spike in volume for drop

WANT:
1) Steady volume throughout day, trending down
2) Sector is not in focus
