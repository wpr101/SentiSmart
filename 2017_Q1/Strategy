Look for companies we want to purchase going into next earnings before the earnings date
Create a range we want to buyin below which would signal a clear value and P/E compression
Prefer stocks that have P/E ratios so far
Need to look how much the general market has risen as well, concluding this season Dow is
about 20500. Examine the P/E rather than the price when possible
Do only in companies you would be willing to hold for a long period
Average software company is 36 P/E

Safe:
FB < 38 P/E
NVDA < 43 P/E
ATVI < 35 P/E

Possible:
AAPL < 14 P/E
GOOG < 26 P/E

Risky:
AMZN < 165 P/E
NOW < 85 Price
SHOP < 50 Price
