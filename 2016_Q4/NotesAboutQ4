-APPL looks like it would have been a winning trade but passed in favor of AMZN

-NVDA moving their earnings means I will have to adjust position sizing a bit

-Tech had a strong rally before this earnings season, strong earnings maybe priced in

-Nasdaq website and Etrade show different earnings dates for some stocks
