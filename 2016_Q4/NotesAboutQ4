-APPL looks like it would have been a winning trade but passed in favor of AMZN

-NVDA moving their earnings means I will have to adjust position sizing a bit

-Tech had a strong rally before this earnings season, strong earnings maybe priced in

-Nasdaq website and Etrade show different earnings dates for some stocks

-Strategy feels more difficult to continue after -15% loss on one trade

-May want to stick to trading companies with P/E before earnings

-Shopify started down day after earnings, but rallied back about 8%

-Should check historical P/E and other data on ycharts.com
